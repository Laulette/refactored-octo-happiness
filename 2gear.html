<p>Appropriate gear is important in rapier fencing. It keeps you safe, and it's required 
for participation in tournaments.</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Sword</dt>
	<dd>Clubs will let you borrow a sword when you first join. Don't buy your own sword until you have a good feel for what you want in a rapier.
	There are all kinds of adjustments you can make—sword length, weight, guard style—to a 
	custom sword, and many of them are well worth the cost, as long as you know what you 
	like. Make sure to buy your sword from a certified, reputable maker that can be trusted with your 
	and others' safety.</dd>
	<dt>Mask</dt>
	<dd>Borrow a mask from your club when you join. Eventually, you'll probably have to 
	get your own—borrowed gear tends to be kind of smelly anyway, and a well-fitting mask
	makes all the difference in a close fight. Buy from a certified, reputable maker.</dd>
	<dt>Gorget</dt>
	<dd>A gorget is a sort of metal or plastic collar with a flap in the back. It protects
	your vulnerable throat and cervical vertebrae from direct hits to the neck.</dd>
	<dt>Jacket</dt>
	<dd>A good puncture-proof jacket is essential. If a sword does break, the jacket provides
	protection for your internal organs. It also shields the arms and torso from hard hits,
	and most high-quality fencing jackets have a blade catcher at the collar, which stops
	the tip of the rapier from sliding up and hitting you in the neck. You can probably borrow
	a jacket for a while, but you'll want your own before long: a good fit aids mobility,
	as well as being more comfortable.</dd>
	<dt>Gloves</dt>
	<dd>Gloves can probably be borrowed at first, but they're inexpensive and easy to find,
	so you might as well buy your own pair. Gloves should be puncture-proof and padded enough
	to give your fingers some protection, but flexible enough for you to easily move your hand.
	Fencing gloves should always be long enough to cover the end of your jacket sleeves with 
	no skin showing.</dd>
	<dt>Hood</dt>
	<dd>Your club may require you to wear a hood. Hoods usually go over the mask and 
	should cover the base of your neck and the back of your head. They help to block the 
	tip of a sword and keep it from hitting your neck or spine.</dd>
	<dt>Pants</dt>
	<dd>Fencing pants are not necessary—any pants that allow you to move freely, cover your
	legs, and do not get in the way should work just fine. However, you may wish to buy 
	fencing knickers if you do not have appropriate pants or want to complete the outfit.</dd>
	<dt>Shoes</dt>
	<dd>What makes a good running shoe does not make a good fencing shoe. When you start 
	fencing, it's okay to wear ordinary athletic shoes, but you'll eventually want to 
	invest in some fencing shoes or similarly-shaped footwear. The design of fencing shoes
	aids balance while allowing you to maintain your moblity.</dd>
