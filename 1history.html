<p>The rapier was at its most popular from the end of the 15th century to the beginning
of the 17th century, though it remained prevalent in certain countries for much longer.</p>

<p>A number of the cut & thrust Masters reveal in their methods the thrusting techniques which were to later develop into the specialty the thrusting or "foining" rapier.  Indeed, many of the early rapier masters must surely have been adept with common cut & thrust swords in the first place. Among the most famous and influential works were some of the first to fully define the new rapier method and it is with it that the greatest Masters are more closely known.  These include Agrippa's treatise in 1553 and Carranza's in 1569, Di Grassi's "His True Arte of Defence" from 1570, Saviolo's 1595 work "His Practice in Two Books", and Francesco Alfieri's "La Sherma" and "La Spadone" of 1640 and 1653.  Some of the most useful dealing with the development of the true rapier are Fabris' "Sienz e Practica d'Arme" of 1606, along with Capo Ferro's "Gran simulacro..." of 1610.  There are of course more than a dozen others, some of which have become favorite influences of practitioners today. Reflecting the diversity of styles and approaches, the Masters of Defence are not always clear in their ideas and even contradict one another.  Yet each offers unique insights.</p>

found in traditional rapier fencing.</p>
