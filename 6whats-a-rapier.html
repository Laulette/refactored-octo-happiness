<p>All rapiers are single-handed weapons, meaning they are wielded with one hand instead
of both. A rapier has a thin and somewhat flexible blade, which decreases the weight of 
the weapon. Most rapiers are quite long, ranging from around 38 to 47 inches along the
blade. Rapiers also have a guard above the handle, which provides hand protection.</p>
<p>These are very general descriptions of the rapier. To give a better idea of what a 
rapier <em>is,</em> let's consider what a rapier <em>isn't.</em></p>
<br>
<dl class="list1">
	<dt>A rapier is not a longsword.</dt>
	<dd>For those unfamiliar with sword types, the rapier and the longsword may appear
	confusingly similar, but they are actually very easy to tell apart. Unlike rapiers, 
	longswords are meant to be wielded with two hands, though some can we wielded with 
	one hand if necessary. Because of this, the pommel of a longsword is longer and there
	is no guard. Despite its name, the average longsword is shorter than the average 
	rapier: "longsword" describes a wide variety of longer two-handed swords, most of which
	are at their most effective when slightly shorter (in blade length) than the average 
	rapier.</dd>

<p class="pic-caption">Hand-and-a-half sword: a type of longsword</p>
<dl class="list1">
	<dt>A rapier is not a smallsword (though a smallsword can be a rapier).</dt>
	<dd>Though even more similar in appearance than the longsword to the rapier, the
	smallsword is a distinct from the rapier in blade shape, length, grip, and technique.
	The blade of a smallsword often has a deep groove on one side to decrease its weight while 
	preserving the strength of the blade. Because smallswords are shorter than rapiers by 
	several inches, smallsword technique involves far more displacement of the sword: the
	wielder can afford to make larger movements because they can move more quickly.
	Some later Spanish rapiers actually can be considered smallswords, as that is what 
	the Spanish rapier evolved into, but some rapier tournaments may not allow them.</dd>

	<dt>A rapier isn't a light weapon.</dt>
	<dd>Don't let your intuition steer you the wrong way. While rapiers are lighter than 
	longswords, they feel heavier during a fight because they are wielded with only one
	hand, and longswords are rarely more than twice as heavy as rapiers. The rapier's 
	length also contributes to its slight unwieldiness.</dd>
	<dd>Strength does matter in rapier fencing, but not as much as you might expect. If 
	you're looking to compete in tournaments, a solid workout routine will keep you from 
	tiring out as quickly as you otherwise would. Strength can also increase speed, but 
	it only matters if your technique is well-developed and precise.</dd>
