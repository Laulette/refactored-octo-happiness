<p>Most modern rapier fencing stays true to the advice and guidelines offered in those works 
of various fencing masters that have managed to survive the centuries. Tournament rules
allow for a certain amount of freedom, but there are some restrictions.</p>
<p>Some of these rules exist for reasons of safety. For example, if the tip of one
person's sword gets caught in the guard of another's, the match is paused and the swords 
are carefully separated. The tip of the caught sword is carefully inspected to ensure that
the rubber tip is still secure. Other rules have more to do with sportsmanship than safety. Though stabs to the back may
be permitted if the person stabbed was facing the person doling out the hit, they are not
allowed if the person stabbed is facing fully away from their opponent. These standard 
tournament rules are usually also used in rapier fencing clubs.</p>
<p>Though you will usually find stricter rules at tournaments and in formal clubs, the 
historically documented style is not the only way to fence with a rapier. It can be well
worth a fencer's time to study other techniques, such as those used in smallsword fencing,
and incorporate them into their rapier fencing style.</p>
