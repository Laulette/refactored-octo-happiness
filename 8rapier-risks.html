	<p>As martial arts go, rapier fencing is very safe. You're likely to get a lot of
	bruises as you learn, but serious injuries are unlikely 
	to occur as long as you follow general safety guidelines, some of which are listed 
	here:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Always wear your gear when sparring.</dt>
	<dd>Sparring without the appropriate equipment is a recipe for disaster. All it takes
	is one really unfortunate misstep, and someone can lose an eye. If you're crossing 
	swords with someone, 
	each of you should be wearing an approved fencing mask, a gorget, a long-sleeved 
	jacket made of puncture-proof material, sturdy gloves, pants that you can move around 
	in, and appropriate close-toed shoes. No skin should be showing, and there should be 
	no gaps in your clothing where a sword could get through.</dd>
	<dt>Warm up and stretch first.</dt>
	<dd>Lunging without first warming up and stretching can lead to serious injury. 
	Getting your blood flowing before you begin can improve balance and decrease the 
	likelihood of muscle tears and snapped ligaments. Just make sure to know your limits:
	it's possible to injure yourself by stretching too far, too.</dd>
	<dt>If your feel yourself get hurt, stop immediately.</dt>
	<dd>If you do feel an ominous twinge in your leg or twist in your knee, stop fencing 
	immediately. If the injury seems even a little bit serious, seek medical attention, 
	and rest your body even if the injury is minor. It's easy to underestimate how hurt
	you are, and some injuries don't heal easily.</dd>
</dl>
	<p>One of the most dangerous things that can happen in rapier fencing is a sword 
	breakage. While most modern fencing rapiers are engineered to snap cleanly in the event of 
	a breakage, it is possible for a broken sword to split into extremely sharp fragments
	that fly away from the point of impulse at high speeds. Without the protection of 
	standard fencing equipment, the shrapnel can pierce skin and cause serious injury.</p>
