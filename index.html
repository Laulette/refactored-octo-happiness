<h1>The Rapier: A Beginner's Journal</h1>
<p>The rapier is the perfect sword. Not for everyone, perhaps, but
certainly for me. I first picked up a rapier in October of 2021, and 
barely a minute in, I knew I was hooked. (Do note that mastery of 
the rapier does not come in the space of a few months, so take from 
this what you will.</p>
