<p>If you want to start rapier fencing, you're going to need to join a club. You might 
get lucky and come upon a free club practicing right in front of your house, but if not,
you have a few options.</p>
<dl>
	<dt>The Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA)</dt>
	<dd>This is a group with a large presence in the USA which can also be found in 
	Canada and eastern Asia. The SCA hosts roleplay reenactments of medieval life and 
	times, and there is a large historical martial arts sub-community. SCA clubs
	can be found in most cities in the US and are a great option for beginners. Club 
	membership is usually free, and as rapiers are a popular weapon among members,
	willing teachers are fairly easy to find. The SCA rapier techniques may be slightly less open to 
	innovation in favor of staying true to documented styles.</dd>
	<dt>Historical European Martial Arts (HEMA)</dt>
	<dd>The HEMA Alliance is the other major option. Like the SCA, they are very widespread,
	and clubs can be found in most large US cities. Unlike SCA clubs, HEMA clubs are not
	automatically affiliated with one larger organization. Instead, they choose to become
	members of the HEMA Alliance, which hosts tournaments and has its own set of rules.
	Not every HEMA club practices rapier fencing, but those who do may be more formal than
	SCA clubs and may require a membership fee. HEMA rapier fencers wear modern rapier 
	fencing gear rather than the historical styles of the SCA.</dd>
	<dt>Local Unaffiliated Clubs</dt>
	<dd>Don't forget to check your area for other rapier fencing clubs! If they're not
	part of the SCA or HEMA database, they may be harder to find, but it's certainly worth
	trying.</dd>
